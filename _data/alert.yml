  text: >-
    Our first P2P Hack Club Meeting is today (Tuesday, 9/27/22), after school in the CCC from 3:20pm-4:20pm!
    The CCC is above the Innovations Classroom, on the second floor where all the counselors are.
    We'll be diving straight into Sprig, which is a coding project that anyone can participate in regardless of
    programming experience! Remember, this is an interest meeting, so if you have any questions this is when to ask,
    and if you have problems with the meeting times then there will be an opportunity to change to a time that works
    better for you! See you there! :)

    meetings as well as updating the site for this year! Be warned: 404 pages, broken links, and old info everywhere! :0
